# Flight Deal Application

Pure Python flight deal application using Tequila and Sheety APIs. It checks the lowest price of flights contained in a Google Sheets through the Sheety API and compares the prices obtained from an API query search using the Tequila API. 

The current project is a minimal implementation of a fully-fledge Flight Deal web application. Thus, future updates will include:
  1) Creating a Flask application to render the results in a live website.
  2) Implementing login functionality to allow for user-specific information.
  3) Implementing a MySQL database to replace the Google Sheets and the Sheety API.
